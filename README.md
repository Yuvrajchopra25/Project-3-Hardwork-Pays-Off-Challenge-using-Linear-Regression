## Introduction:
#### Predicting Exam Scores using Machine Learning
Since we are student of Coding Blocks, we are expected to work hard and get better results than others. To track our time and expected performance in the Machine Learning Challenge, Prateek bhayia has asked us to install walkatime on our device which is an efficient time tracking tool to track our daily coding activity. It measures how much time we have spend on coding daily.

## Problem Statement:
In this challenge, Prateek bhayia gives us walkatime data of his past students and how they performed in the evaluation exam. Our task is to predict the score we will get given the amount of time we spend on coding daily.

## Requirements:
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset:
- Input:- We are given one feature corresponding to time noted by walkatime.

- Output:- A scalar denoting the level of perfomance student achived by devoting the given time.

## Importing the Modules:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## LinearRegression:
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.

## Score:
For this model, the accuracy on the test set is **0.97**, which means the model made the right prediction for **97%** of the  dataset. We can expect the model to be correct **97%** of the time for predicting the new values from different students.

## Summary:
The Hardwork Pays Off Challenge (and our implementation) is a perfect example to illustrate how a machine learning problem should be approached and how useful the outcome can be to a potential student who wanted to track his performance.
